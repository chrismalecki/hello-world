testing "hello-world" 

Hey there,

I'm Chris Malecki! 
I go to school at the University of Waterloo (UW). 
I'm currently a course in Computational Modelling in Neuroscience/Psychology. 
I've also participated heavily in Hack the North which started at UW, where I've met some incredibly talented, driven and intelligent people. Because of their influence, I'm eager to learn more about programming.
That about wraps it up! (for now)
